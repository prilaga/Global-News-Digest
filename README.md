# Global-News-Digest
**Note: Currently the app is deprecated & unpublished from Google Play.**

This is a demo app named Global News Digest.
I used MVP pattern, Dependency Injection with Dagger 2, request to https://newsapi.org API with Retrofit 2.2 and all working with RxJava.
- For test purposes I added ability to change base url of API and added Mock server (it's working offline), so you able to change it in the settings of the app.
- Implemented cache feature. All data stored in the cache and retrieved from it by request parameters. So I avoid additional data loading from network.
- Created custom card views for Sources and Articles of news.
- Added ability to change sources of news.
- Created animated views and placed on toolbar
